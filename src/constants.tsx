//   Roster Construction Path
//   MLS rosters will feature six discretionary spending roster spots with the flexibility to choose between two models, tailorable to a team’s roster-building strategy.
//   Clubs will be required to submit and announce their 2025 roster construction path by the Roster Compliance Date on Feb. 21.
//   Three Designated Player Model
//   Up to three Designated Players AND;

//   General Allocation Money received under the U22 Initiative Player Model must be used within the same league season and by Roster Freeze Date. This GAM may be traded but the club receiving the GAM in a trade still must use it in the same league season consistent with the above.
//   Clubs will conditionally have the opportunity to update their roster construction model at midseason – between July 1, 2025, and the close of the Secondary Transfer Window on Aug. 21. Conditions for updating roster construction models at midseason:
//   Updates must be made between July 1, 2025 and the close of the Secondary Transfer Window (Aug. 21).
//   U22 Initiative Player Model to Designated Player Model – The club must have used $1 million or less of the additional GAM and have no more than three U22 Initiative Players on their roster as of their updated declaration.
//   Designated Player Model to U22 Initiative Player Model – The club may only invest up to $1 million of additional GAM during the remainder of the season and must have no more than two Designated Players on their roster as of their updated declaration.

//   Designated Player
//   The Designated Player rule allows clubs to acquire up to three players whose total compensation and acquisition costs exceed the Maximum Salary Budget Charge, with the club bearing financial responsibility for the amount of compensation above each player's Salary Budget Charge. Designated Players may be new players signed to MLS via the Discovery Process, or they may be re-signed existing players on a club's roster.
//   The number of Designated Player Slots available to each team will be based on the roster construction model they choose at the beginning of a respective season. For 2025, clubs must declare their path by Feb. 21, the Roster Compliance Date.
//   A player's Salary Budget Charge, and therefore Designated Player status, is generally determined by averaging all guaranteed amounts payable over the guaranteed term.
//   In 2025, a Designated Player who is at least 24 years old during the League Year will carry the Maximum Salary Budget Charge ($743,750) unless the player joins his club after the opening of the Secondary Transfer Window, in which case his budget charge will be $371,875.
//   Clubs may "buy down" the Salary Budget Charge of a Designated Player with General Allocation Money. The reduced budget charge may not be less than $150,000.
//   Clubs may trade a Designated Player or U22 Initiative Player, remain responsible for some or all future out of pocket costs, and shed the Designated Player or U22 Initiative Player slot designation under the following limitations:
//   Up to one Designated Player traded per year (two total “active” at any given time)
//   Up to one U22 Initiative Player traded per year (two total “active” at any given time)
//   Player may only be traded beginning in his second MLS season
//   Roster Slot Designation (Designated Player or U22 Initiative) must be held by one of the two trading teams

//   Transfer of a Designated Player
//   If a Designated Player, who is eligible to be bought down, is transferred out of MLS, the club may convert the transfer fee to General Allocation Money only after all prior out-of-pocket amounts are recouped. If the Designated Player is not eligible to be bought down, then General Allocation money may not be taken from the transfer. This also applies to Young Designated Players.
//   Young Designated Player
//   A Designated Player who is 23 years old (or younger than the age of 23) during the League Year (the age of the player is determined by year - not date - of birth) will carry the following Young Designated Player Salary Budget Charge:
//   Ages 20 and younger: $150,000
//   Ages 21-23: $200,000
//   If such a Young Designated Player joins the club after the opening of the Secondary Transfer Window, he will carry the Mid-Season Young Designated Player Salary Budget Charge of $150,000.
//   Each club will be allotted up to three Designated Player roster slots based on the roster construction model they choose at the beginning of the year. Clubs with two Designated Players may add a third Designated Player by paying $150,000 to the League, which shall be split among clubs with two or fewer occupied Designated Player slots for use as General Allocation Money in the following MLS season. Clubs must pay the $150,000 fee every year in which a third Designated Player slot is occupied on the club's roster.
//   If a club uses the third Designated Player slot to sign a Young Designated Player, then the club will not be obligated to pay the $150,000 charge.
//   Designated Player slots are not tradable.

//   U22 Initiative Roster Slots
//   Number of Slots:
//   Each MLS team will have either three or four U22 Initiative roster slots available, with each occupying one of the 20 existing Senior Roster Slots. The number of U22 Initiative Slots available to each team will be based on the roster construction model they choose at the beginning of a respective season. For 2025, clubs must choose their roster construction path by the Roster Compliance Date on Feb. 21.
//   Eligibility for U22 Initiative Slot:
//   Age: A player must be twenty-two years old or younger in the first year he is eligible to play in an MLS game (e.g., not eligible for 2025 if he turns 23 in 2025). A player who signs at age 22 or younger may continue to occupy a U22 Initiative Slot through the year in which he turns 25, provided that for non-Homegrown players, such player is on his initial contract. A Homegrown player may continue to occupy a U22 Initiative Slot through the year in which he turns 25, provided he must be on his first or second contract and the applicable contract must have been signed at age 22 or younger.
//   Contract: A player is eligible to occupy a U22 Initiative Slot if signing his first contract with MLS, provided that player meets age and compensation requirements, as either a Homegrown player, or, as an international or domestic player playing outside of MLS. A player will be eligible to occupy a U22 Initiative Slot during his second contract provided that he meets the age and compensation requirements and signed his first contract with MLS as either a Homegrown or SuperDraft player.
//   Compensation: A player’s salary may not exceed the Maximum Salary Budget Charge in any given year, including option years. A Homegrown or SuperDraft player on his second contract may earn up to $200,000 above the Maximum Salary Budget Charge in any given year, including option years.
//   In addition, clubs may pay, without limit, additional amounts in the form of acquisition fees (i.e. transfer or loan fees).
//   U22 Initiative Slot Budget Charge:
//   Players occupying a U22 Initiative Slot will have a Salary Budget Charge that mirrors that of a Young Designated Player:
//   Ages 20 and younger: $150,000
//   Ages 21-25: $200,000
//   All such amounts above the first $150,000 or $200,000 accounted for on the Salary Budget will be paid on a discretionary basis by the club.
//   Transfer of Player:
//   In the event a player occupying a U22 Initiative Slot is transferred outside of the League, 95% of the proceeds of the sale (after out-of-pocket amounts are recouped) will be paid to the club and such amounts may be converted to General Allocation Money

//   Reclassification of a Player from a U22 Initiative Slot:
//   To remove a U22 Initiative Slot classification, a club may: transfer the player out of MLS, remove the player from a U22 Initiative Slot using Targeted Allocation Money or General Allocation Money, loan the player outside of MLS, utilize one of its two Buyouts, or transition the player to a Designated Player slot.
//   If the contract of a player occupying a U22 Initiative Slot is renegotiated prior to its conclusion, the League will not reclassify the player and he may continue to occupy a U22 Initiative Slot until his initial contract would have otherwise expires depending on compensation.
//   Salary Limitation in Options and Years 26+
//   If a player’s contract includes Options, compensation during the Options may exceed the Maximum Salary Budget Charge only if it is in a year the player is no longer required to occupy a U22 Initiative Slot. These players would not be eligible to occupy a U22 Initiative Slot in the Option year regardless of age if the compensation exceeds the Maximum Salary Budget Charge.
//   If a player’s contract covers years in which he is no longer eligible to occupy a U22 Initiative Slot (i.e., the seasons of his 26+ birthday), the player’s compensation may exceed the Maximum Salary Budget Charge provided it is during an Option year.

//   Player Acquisition Mechanisms
//   Clubs may acquire players and add them to their rosters via the following mechanisms:
//   SuperDraft
//   The MLS SuperDraft 2025 consisted of three rounds of player selection.
//   MLS clubs may draft players through the MLS SuperDraft from a list of eligible players which may include:
//   Players who are collegiate sophomores and above;
//   Generation adidas players;
//   Any former college player who departed college with remaining eligibility since the conclusion of the college season approximately one (1) year prior to the SuperDraft (i.e., since the conclusion of the 2023 college season) in order to compete as a professional in a league domestically; and
//   Any other players specifically made available by the league (such as pre-signed College seniors or pre-signed internationals).
//   Clubs may nominate players for the League's Draft-Eligible List, and only players from that list may be selected.
//   The MLS SuperDraft order is set by taking the reverse order of the club standings at the end of each MLS season, taking postseason performance into account, with new expansion clubs at the top of the order.
//   SuperDraft Priority List
//   Unless claimed on Waivers, a player who was drafted by a particular club through the MLS SuperDraft and did not sign with the League is placed on that club's "SuperDraft Priority List" until December 31 of the year after the draft (i.e., for 2025 MLS SuperDraft, until December 31, 2026), after which the club loses the priority rights to sign the player.
//   Trades
//   Players, cash, General Allocation Money, international roster slots, SuperDraft Priority players, Discovery Priority, and Homegrown Player priority in addition to selection position in MLS SuperDraft, Re-Entry Process, and Waivers may all be exchanged in trades approved by the League, provided all of the necessary rules regarding roster and Salary Budget compliance are met and the trade is completed during a valid trading period.
//   Cash for Player Trades
//   Beginning in 2025, MLS clubs may use an unlimited amount of out-of-pocket funds (cash) to trade for players. No other consideration (e.g., SuperDraft picks, General Allocation Money, International Roster Slots, a specific player’s Right of First Refusal or any other priority mechanism) may be included in a Cash for Player Trade. Limitations for these trades include:
//   Cash may not be used for Intraleague Loans, unless it is the execution of a permanent trade option.
//   A club may trade away up to two players, and acquire up to two players, per MLS Season in exchange for cash. The cash traded may not be less than $50,000.
//   Cash may be paid in installments as agreed by the clubs, which may not go beyond the guaranteed term of a player’s current contract or new contract signed in connection with the trade.
//   Clubs may include sell-on provisions and conditional payments.
//   Player Percentage
//   A player traded for cash is eligible for and may receive an amount equal to 10% of the cash traded as part of the Player Percentage. The Player Percentage is the responsibility of the acquiring club as a part of the player’s Salary Budget Charge. A player may also choose to waive or amend the Player Percentage.
//   Player Designation and Salary Budget Treatment
//   The acquiring club must declare the player’s Roster and Budget designation, which will be determined by the player’s compensation set forth in his contract, any other player-related costs, including the cash traded and any Player Percentage received, and any existing payment obligations to a non-MLS third-party under a previous acquisition agreement.
//   One-Time Payments: Any prior one-time payments would not be considered in the player’s Salary Budget Charge or roster category determination after the effective date of the trade and would remain the responsibility of the player’s former club.
//   Eligibility: Category eligibility will be determined based on the player’s remaining guaranteed contract or the new guaranteed contract signed in connection with the trade.
//   U22 Initiative Players: A player traded for cash may be designated as a U22 Initiative Player if he satisfies the U22 Initiative Player age and compensation parameters following the effective date of the trade.
//   Player Conversion Prohibition: If the acquiring club designates a player as a DP or U22 Initiative Player, the player may not be converted to a different Roster and Budget category during the player’s remaining guaranteed contract term.
//   Special Discovery: The Special Discovery mechanism is not available for a player acquired in a Cash for Player Trade.
//   For a player declared a non-discretionary player (i.e., non-DP, non-U22 Initiative Player) by the acquiring club, the former club trading the player away must convert its received cash to GAM. For a player declared a U22 Initiative Player or DP by the acquiring club, the former club may convert its received cash to GAM. For outgoing transfers and trades for cash that are effective in a given season, a club may not exceed a combined $3,000,000 in total GAM received from these deals. The overall $3,000,000 limit applies irrespective of whether a trade for cash requires a club to convert its received cash to GAM

//   Discovery Process
//   Discovery List
//   Pursuant to the Discovery Process, clubs may scout and sign players who are not yet under contract to MLS and who are not subject to another assignment mechanism (e.g., MLS SuperDraft). To sign a player through the Discovery Process, the club must first place the player on its Discovery List. A club may have up to five players on its Discovery List at any time and may remove or add players at any time. There is no limit to how many players a club can sign from its Discovery List. Expansion club San Diego FC may maintain seven Discovery List slots through the 2025 Roster Compliance Date, at which point the number of slots will be reduced to five.
//   Players who were previously on the Allocation Ranking List are now eligible for the Discovery Process. Players transferred out of Major League Soccer will become discoverable one week from when the player's ITC is permanently transferred and the League has notified all clubs.
//   Clubs may not add the following players to their Discovery Lists:
//   Current MLS players
//   Players who have played in MLS and were subsequently waived or terminated (such players are available on a first-come, first-served basis)
//   Players for whom another club has a Right of First Refusal
//   Players who played at college during the college season immediately prior to the date of discovery, and were not on the MLS SuperDraft List, shall be placed on Waivers
//   Players who leave or forgo college with remaining eligibility by signing a professional soccer playing, and were not on the MLS SuperDraft List, contract shall be placed on Waivers and are non-Discoverable until one (1) year after the date he left or forwent college
//   Underage players (i.e., players under the age of 18 if domestic or under the age of 17 if outside of the U.S. or Canada)
//   Homegrown-eligible players (i.e., another club has achieved or is in the process of achieving Homegrown Priority over such a player)
//   Free Agents
//   Designated Player Requests
//   If a club wishes to add a player to its Discovery List whom the League determines will require a significant investment from the club, the League will, prior to placing that player on a club’s Discovery List, determine whether the club has the necessary intent, means, and ability to sign such a player. The League may contact the player’s current club (if applicable) and/or his authorized representative to determine the likelihood of reaching an agreement. If the League determines that there is no realistic chance of signing the player at that time he will not be discoverable.
//   Discovery Conflict Resolution
//   If one or more clubs attempt to add the same player to their respective Discovery Lists, the club that filed the claim on the earlier date will have the priority right to sign the player. If one or more clubs submit a discovery request on the same day, then the club with the lowest points-per-game in the current MLS regular season (all clubs must have played a minimum of three regular season games) will have the priority right to sign the player.
//   If a club wants to sign a player on the Discovery List of another club that has higher Discovery priority on the player, it may offer that club $50,000 in General Allocation Money in exchange for the right to sign the player. The club with the player on its Discovery List will then have five days (or three days during the Secondary Transfer Window) to either (i) accept the General Allocation Money and pass on the right to sign the player or (ii) make the player a genuine, objectively reasonable offer.
//   Related Party Transactions
//   All terms of any arrangements among an MLS club, a related party club, and a player to be signed to MLS shall be fully disclosed to the League. A player joining an MLS club from a related party club will calculate his Salary Budget Charge based on the compensation he is receiving from his related party club contract and any acquisition fees associated with his signing. The League will make a final determination, in its sole discretion, as to the Salary Budget Charge of such a player.
//   Homegrown Player Signings
//   A club may sign a player to a contract without subjecting him to the MLS SuperDraft if the player has been a member of that club’s youth academy for at least one year and has met the necessary requirements. Players joining MLS through this mechanism are known as Homegrown Players.
//   There is no limit on the number of Homegrown Players a club may sign in any given year.
//   Affiliate Priority Players
//   In addition to Homegrown Players and SuperDraft Priority Players, clubs may have priority for up to seven players from their respective affiliates (MLS NEXT Pro). Such players will not count towards the seven Discovery List slots. In order to retain priority on any additional affiliate players, such players must be added to an MLS club’s Discovery List.

//   Re-Entry Process
//   The Re-Entry Process is summarized below and subject to the 2020-2028 MLS Collective Bargaining Agreement.
//   The Re-Entry Process will commence after MLS Cup. The priority order for the Re-Entry Draft is the reverse order of finish, taking into account playoff performance. Players who are available to be selected in Re-Entry Draft include all option decline and out of contract players who are 22 years old or older with at least one MLS service year and who are not eligible for Free Agency.
//   Stage One
//   Players who are available in Stage One of the Re-Entry Draft are:
//   Players who are at least 22 years old and have a minimum of one MLS service year whose options were not exercised by their clubs or are out of contract.
//   Players who are at least 22 years old and have a minimum of one MLS service year who are out of contract and whose club does not wish to re-sign them at a $15,000 increase or 10% increase in salary over his prior year’s salary.
//   Clubs must exercise the option for, or extend a Bona Fide Offer (i.e., $15,000 increase or 10% increase in salary over his prior year’s salary) to, all players selected in Stage One and may not select their own draft-eligible players. Should a player reject the offer, the drafting club will hold the Right of First Refusal for that player in MLS. Players with option years left on their contract will automatically be added to the drafting club's roster.
//   Stage Two
//   Players who are not selected in Stage One of the Re-Entry Draft will be made available in Stage Two. If a player is selected in Stage Two, the drafting club will be required to make a genuine offer to the player. If an agreement cannot be reached between the drafting club and the player, the drafting club will hold the Right of First Refusal for that player in MLS. Clubs may not select their own draft-eligible players in Stage Two until all other clubs have declined to select such players.
//   Players who remain unselected after Stage Two will be available to any MLS club on a first-come, first-served basis.
//   A player may choose to opt out of the Re-Entry Process prior to Stage One and/or Stage Two of the Re-Entry Draft. In such instances, the Right of First Refusal for the player will remain with his previous club and the club will be required to obtain the player’s consent before trading the player.
//   Free Agency
//   Free Agency will be conducted in accordance with the 2020-2028 MLS Collective Bargaining Agreement.
//   Waivers
//   A club may place a player on Waivers at any time during the regular season at which point he is made available to all other MLS clubs. The Waiver Claiming Period shall commence on the first business day after the League delivers notice to clubs and expires at 5 p.m. ET on the second business day. If a player is not selected off Waivers ("clears Waivers") then that player is available to all MLS clubs on a first-come, first-served basis.
//   Waiver Order
//   The Waiver Order is based on points per game once all clubs have played at least three MLS League Season games. If the Waiver takes place prior to all clubs playing in at least three MLS League Season games, priority is granted based upon the previous MLS season's performance, taking playoff performance into account first, with clubs eliminated from playoff contention at the same stage separated according to their point totals through the end of the regular season. New expansion clubs shall be at the bottom of the Waiver Order until all clubs have played at least three MLS League Season games.
//   Claiming an Out of Contract Player
//   If a club claims a player who was previously signed to an MLS contract but is no longer signed to an MLS contract, the club must issue the player a genuine offer within three business days.
//   Claiming a Guaranteed Player
//   If a player with a guaranteed contract is waived, any interested MLS club will have 48 hours from the notice of Waivers to claim the player by notifying the League of the intention to claim the player and the amount of the player's Salary Budget Charge they wish to assume. The player will be awarded based on a number of factors, including but not limited to, Waiver Order and which club is willing to absorb a Salary Budget Charge that is meaningfully higher than other clubs and at least $15,000 higher than Senior Minimum Salary.
//   Players who are eligible to be placed on Waivers are as follows:
//   Contracted Players: Any player with an SPA.
//   Completed College Eligibility: Any player who has completed his college eligibility in the MLS season immediately prior to the MLS SuperDraft and was not on the MLS SuperDraft list.
//   Remaining College Eligibility: A player who left or forgoes college with remaining eligibility (and was not on the MLS SuperDraft list). Such players will be discoverable one year after leaving or forgoing college with remaining eligibility.
//   Returning Players: A player returning to MLS who the League was unable to re-sign and his last MLS club does not wish to exercise their Right of First Refusal, or who was previously terminated without going through Waivers.
//   Unsigned Drafted Players: The day after the drafting club's first MLS regular season game, college players selected in that year's SuperDraft who have not returned to school or signed an MLS contract have the right to be placed on Waivers upon request. If an unsigned college player is placed on Waivers and is not claimed by another MLS club, he will return to his drafting club's College Protected List until the end of the College Protected Period.
//   Out-of-Contract/Option Decline Players: Any player whose contract has expired or option has been declined, is not eligible for the Re-Entry Process or Free Agency, and who was not offered a genuine offer by his former club. Such a player will be typically made available in a year-end Waiver Draft or prior to the start of the next MLS League Season.
//   Once a club selects a player off Waivers, that club is automatically moved to the bottom of the priority list for subsequent Waiver selections in any given season.
//   Affiliate Short-Term Agreements
//   A club may sign a player, age 25 or younger during the league season, from its affiliate (MLS NEXT Pro) to a maximum of four Short-Term Agreements (up to four-day contracts) each season (maximum of 16 days).
//   An individual player may be included on up to four MLS league season match rosters each season, however, that player may appear in no more than two MLS league season matches. An individual player may appear in any number of non-league games during the terms of his four Short-Term Agreements.
//   A club may roster up to four players on Short-Term Agreements per MLS league season match, so long as they are Homegrown Players or players earning less than or equal to the MLS Senior Minimum Salary ($104,000) with the affiliate. This number will be reduced to one player per MLS league season match after Roster Freeze (inclusive of MLS Cup Playoffs). Additional players may also be signed to Short-Term Agreements for MLS league season games but only in cases of Extreme Hardship.
//   Off-Roster Homegrown Players are eligible for up to six appearances via Short-Term Agreements in League Season matches and unlimited appearances in Cup competitions (Concacaf Champions Cup, Leagues Cup, Lamar Hunt U.S. Open Cup, Canadian Championship, friendlies, etc.).
//   International Player limits still apply to Short-Term Agreements, excluding callups for cases of Extreme Hardship.
//   Extreme Hardship Call-ups
//   Clubs may add players to their roster in cases of "Extreme Hardship." Extreme Hardship exists when an MLS club has either:
//   Fewer than 16 outfield players available; OR
//   Has fewer than two goalkeepers available.
//   A club may sign players, on loan, to Short-Term Agreements (up to four-day contracts) for MLS league season games in cases of Extreme Hardship.
//   Season-Ending Injury
//   Season-Ending Injury List
//   If a player suffers a season-ending injury, a club may place that injured player on the Season-Ending Injury List and receive roster relief (i.e., an open roster slot). Once placed on the Season-Ending Injury List, the injured player will not be eligible to play for the club in any remaining competition during that MLS season (including any exhibition games or tournaments, including but not limited to: Leagues Cup, Campeones Cup, CONCACAF Champions Cup, Canadian Championship and Lamar Hunt U.S. Open Cup.
//   Season-Ending Injury Replacement Player
//   A club may replace an injured player that is on the Season-Ending Injury List with a replacement player in accordance with parameters below.
//   The club will remain responsible for the injured player's full Salary Budget Charge. Clubs are only able to receive Salary Budget relief (paid out of the club's own pocket) for a season-ending injury replacement under the following parameters:
//   The injured player must be formally placed on the Season-Ending Injury List prior to the opening of the Secondary Transfer Window. The replacement player must be declared as such when being added to the club’s roster and must be acquired by the Roster Freeze date (Sept. 12, 2025) and after the related injury occurred.
//   The Salary Budget Charge of the replacement player may not be more than the player who suffered the season-ending injury. If the injured player placed on the Season-Ending Injury List is a Designated Player, the club may replace such player with a Designated Player, provided that his Salary Budget Charge is not more than the player he is replacing. The replacement player’s charge will not be charged against the Club Salary Budget.
//   Clubs will only be allowed to sign one such replacement player per MLS league season.
//   If the injured player occupies an international roster slot on the Senior Roster, the replacement player may also be an International Player.
//   Supplemental Season-Ending Injury
//   If a player on a club's Supplemental Roster suffers a season-ending injury, a club may replace that injured player with a player earning the Reserve Minimum Salary irrespective of the salary earned by the injured player (e.g., if a Generation adidas Player earning more than the Reserve Minimum Salary is injured, he may be replaced by a player earning the Reserve Minimum Salary (subject to the Club Salary Budget)). The Reserve Minimum Salary of such replacement player will be charged to the Club Salary Budget.
//   Accordingly, a club must have Salary Budget space to replace a player with a season-ending injury on the Supplemental Roster with a replacement player.
//   If the injured player occupies an international roster slot on the Supplemental Roster, the replacement player may also be an International Player.
//   Short-Term Injury Replacements
//   Injured List
//   If a player suffers an injury that will prohibit him from participating in six or more MLS league season games, a club can place that injured player on the Injured List. An injured player placed on the Injured List will remain unavailable for a minimum of six MLS league season games and may not participate in any exhibition games or tournaments during that period, including CONCACAF Champions Cup, Canadian Championship, Lamar Hunt U.S. Open Cup, Leagues Cup, and Campeones Cup games.
//   Senior Roster Players on the Injured List
//   If a player on a club's Senior Roster is put on the Injured List, the club may receive roster relief (i.e., an open roster slot). The club will not receive salary budget relief for that player and will be responsible for the injured player's full Salary Budget Charge. Only clubs that have or can create extra Salary Budget space will be able to temporarily replace players on the Injured List. A club must have priority over any replacement player it adds (e.g., via Discovery, Right of First Refusal, etc.)
//   If the injured player occupies an international roster slot on the Senior Roster, the replacement player may also be an International Player.
//   NOTE: No changes may be made to a club's roster after the Roster Freeze Date (Sept. 12, 2025) and running through the day after MLS Cup. Nevertheless, a club may obtain players in accordance with the Extreme Hardship rules and procedures after the Roster Freeze Date.
//   Methods of Removing a Player from a Roster
//   Waivers
//   Clubs may waive players at any time during the MLS season. A club may waive a Semi-Guaranteed Player at any time during the regular season until three business days prior to the Contract Guarantee Date. A club may waive a Guaranteed Player (at any time) or a Semi-Guaranteed Player (after the Contract Guarantee Date) only with League approval. Clubs may not waive a player between the Roster Freeze Date and MLS Cup.
//   Semi-Guaranteed Players waived on or after the Contract Guarantee Date and Guaranteed Players waived anytime, and who clear Waivers (i.e., not picked up by another club), will continue to have their respective Salary Budget Charges count against the applicable Club Salary Budgets.
//   Transfers and Loans
//   An MLS player may be transferred or loaned at any time to a non-MLS club (subject to the receiving club's applicable federation's transfer window), and subject to the consent of the player.
//   Transfer and Loan Fees
//   The revenue share from transfers or loans for clubs is as follows:
//   A club shall receive 95% of the corresponding transfer or loan fee revenue from any transaction, after it has recouped all out-of-pocket cash payments made by the club in connection to that player (if applicable).
//   Usage of Revenue
//   The club's share of transfer revenue may only be used as follows:
//   A club may assign a maximum of $3,000,000 of transfer, loan revenue as General Allocation Money per season. GAM earned through player transfers can be applied in the current or future seasons.
//   The above limits also include amounts clubs receive in Cash for Player trades.
//   The remaining balance of the club's share (if any), and which cannot be traded, will be distributed by the League to the club as cash.
//   Intraleague Loans
//   Clubs may loan players to another MLS club subject to the following:
//   A field player must be 24 years old (or younger than the age of 24) during the League Year (i.e., cannot turn twenty-five (25) during the League Year); a goalkeeper must be 28 years old (or younger than the age of 28) during the League Year (i.e., cannot turn twenty-eight (28) during the League Year).
//   Each club may loan up to two players to another MLS club per season.
//   The loan must be initiated during the Primary Transfer Window or Secondary Transfer Window.
//   Intraleague Loans that are initiated prior to the close of the Primary Transfer Window may allow the loaned player to be recalled during the Secondary Transfer Window as agreed upon between the two clubs. If recalled, such a player must remain with his original club for the remainder of the MLS season.
//   Except in an instance where the player is recalled as outlined above, he must remain with his new club for the entire MLS Season.
//   The player may compete against his former club during the MLS Season while on loan (includes MLS League Season games and all other competitions).
//   Loan of a Player by MLS
//   A club may loan any player from its Senior Roster or Supplemental Roster to a non-MLS club, subject to League discretion. During the loan period, the club will receive roster relief but not Salary Budget relief unless otherwise determined pursuant to the loan agreement.
//   For Designated Players and U22 Initiative Players who are loaned to an international club after the first calendar year in which the player has been signed to an MLS contract, the club may open up such loaned player’s DP slot or U22 Player Slot during the loan period and receive full Salary Budget Charge relief if the international club is responsible for all player compensation during the loan period.
//   A player’s amortized incoming acquisition fees will not impact the Salary Budget Charge during the outgoing loan period and the player must be a DP or U22 Player at the time of the loan to be eligible. In the event of an offseason loan, the player must have been a DP or U22 Player as of the immediately prior Roster Freeze Date. If the player is recalled from his loan, the club must have an available roster slot in order for the player to be eligible for MLS League Season games.
//   If the loaned player is an International Player, then his replacement may be an International Player and occupy an international roster slot.
//   Loan of a Player by MLS to Affiliate Club (MLS NEXT Pro)
//   All loans from MLS clubs to its affiliates must be free (i.e., no loan fees paid by MLS NEXT Pro affiliate clubs).
//   If an MLS player is loaned to an affiliate, such a player may not be paid more than the player's Salary Budget Charge without that compensation being captured on the MLS club's Salary Budget (including, but not limited to, performance bonus compensation).
//   An MLS club can receive roster relief and budget relief for a maximum of one player loaned to its MLS NEXT Pro affiliate or a lower-division club in the U.S. or Canada; provided, however, that:
//   The player is under the age of 25 (i.e., he does not turn 25 prior to the end of the calendar year);
//   The player's Salary Budget Charge is less than or equal to the MLS Senior Minimum Salary (including any loan fees, transfer fees, agent fees, housing, car, etc.); and
//   The loan must be a season-long free loan;
//   The player has not appeared on a gameday roster for the MLS Club as of the beginning of the applicable loanee club’s season; and
//   The loan of the player to the loanee club must last for the remaining duration of the entire loanee club’s season; provided, however, that such a player may be recalled to his MLS club in the case of Extreme Hardship.
//   Buyout of Guaranteed Contract
//   A club may buyout up to two players (including a Designated Player) who have a Guaranteed Contract and free up the corresponding Salary Budget space each year. Such a buyout is at the club's expense and may apply to any mutually terminated contracted player or to a contract that remains in effect.
//   The buyout may be conducted in-season or during the offseason. If the buyout is conducted in-season, it must be concluded by the close of the Secondary Transfer Window.
//   Before a player is considered a buyout, the league in its discretion may place the player on Waivers to be made available to all clubs.
//   If a team no longer has its two buyouts of a guaranteed contract, it may enter settlement discussions with a player, but such settlement shall continue to apply to the team’s Salary Budget. If said player is a Designated Player, he will continue to occupy a Designated Player position on the team’s roster.
//   Right of First Refusal
//   Subject to rules regarding the Re-Entry Draft and Free Agency, if a former MLS player, who the League previously attempted but was unable to re-sign, returns to MLS, his former club will have a Right of First Refusal.
//   That club will not have a Right of First Refusal if:
//   The club received any consideration in connection with the transfer of such player to a non-MLS club; or
//   The player was excluded from possible selection in the Expansion Draft.
//   Allocation Money
//   Allocation Money is money that is available to a club in addition to its Salary Budget, as either (i) General Allocation Money; or (ii) Targeted Allocation Money (guidelines for each set below).
//   General Allocation Money
//   Each club receives an annual allotment of General Allocation Money (GAM). In 2025, that allotment is $2,930,000per club. A club may also receive up to an additional $2,000,000 in General Allocation Money if they select the U22 Initiative Player roster construction model prior to the start of the season. A club may also receive General Allocation Money in the following cases:
//   Failure to qualify for the MLS Cup Playoffs
//   The transfer of a club’s player to non-MLS club outside MLS
//   Qualification for the CONCACAF Champions Cup
//   Qualification for the Club World Cup (see below)
//   Expansion Clubs (see below)
//   Expansion Dilution (see below)
//   Designated Player charge distribution
//   In any year that the League adds one or more expansion clubs, (i) all clubs will receive an equal amount of General Allocation Money and (ii) any club that loses a player in the Expansion Draft will receive additional General Allocation Money. New expansion clubs receive a separate amount of General Allocation Money for their inaugural season.
//   General Allocation Money can be traded by clubs. General Allocation money does not expire except for GAM received under the U22 Initiative Player Model, which must be used within the same league season and by the Roster Freeze Date.
//   2025 FIFA Club World Cup
//   In support of the two MLS clubs participating in the 2025 FIFA Club World Cup, the MLS Board of Governors approved the following allowances:
//   Each club will have an additional $750,000 of 2025 General Allocation Money.
//   Each club may pull forward up to $1,250,000 of General Allocation Money, which must then be paid back over two years, beginning in 2026.
//   Buy-Down
//   Allocation Money can be used to "buy-down" a player's Salary Budget Charge as part of managing a club's roster, including buying down a Salary Budget Charge below the League maximum of $743,750. For example, a club may buy-down a player earning $800,000 to a Salary Budget Charge of $400,000 by using $400,000 of General Allocation Money.
//   Use against a Salary Budget Charge
//   A club can use General Allocation Money to reduce a player's Salary Budget Charge to the lesser of 50% of the Salary Budget Charge or $150,000. This restriction does not apply where General Allocation Money is being used on a loan or transfer fee; a club may reduce 100% of a loan or transfer fee.
//   Targeted Allocation Money Available Per Year
//   2025: $2,225,000 per club
//   2026: $2,125,000 per club
//   2027: $2,025,000 per club
//   Targeted Allocation Money may be used in the following ways:
//   Clubs may use the funds to sign a new player provided his salary and acquisition costs are more than the Maximum Salary Budget Charge.
//   Clubs may re-sign an existing player provided he is earning more than the Maximum Salary Budget Charge.
//   Clubs may use all or a portion of the available Targeted Allocation Money to convert a Designated Player to a non-Designated Player (assuming such player’s Salary Budget Charge meets the salary parameters described below) by buying down his Salary Budget Charge at or below the Maximum Salary Budget Charge.
//   A club retains the flexibility to convert a player previously bought down with Targeted Allocation Money into a Designated Player if that club has a free Designated Player slot.
//   Targeted Allocation Money may not be traded.
//   Salary Parameters
//   A player must earn more than 2025 Maximum Salary Budget Charge ($743,750) to qualify for Targeted Allocation Money. The compensation ceiling for such eligible players is set at $1,743,750 in 2025.
//   A player cannot have his Salary Budget Charge bought down below $150,000 using Targeted Allocation Money.

// export const testResponse = `
// **Feasibility of the Trade:**

// Based on the provided information, the proposed trade of Luis Abram to Charlotte FC is feasible within the MLS salary budget rules.

// * **Salary Cap:** Abram's base salary of $732,275 is below the maximum allowed budget charge for a non-designated player ($683,750).
// * **Roster Spot:** Abram would occupy a senior roster spot (slots 1-20), which Charlotte FC has available as they can have up to 24 players on the senior roster.

// **Financial Implications for Charlotte FC:**

// * **Budget Charge:** Abram's salary would count as $732,275 against Charlotte FC's salary budget of $5,470,000 (2024).
// * **Salary Relief:** Charlotte FC could potentially use General Allocation Money (GAM) or Targeted Allocation Money (TAM) to reduce Abram's budget charge, but it cannot be reduced below $150,000.

// **Impact on Charlotte FC's Roster Construction:**

// * **Roster Size:** Adding Abram would increase Charlotte FC's senior roster size to 19.
// * **Roster Balance:** Abram is a center back, so his addition would strengthen Charlotte FC's defense. However, they would need to consider the overall balance of their roster, including the number of international players and designated players.

// **Other Considerations:**

// * **Availability:** It's not clear if Abram is available for a trade or if Atlanta United is willing to transfer him.
// * **Transfer Fee:** The proposed trade does not mention any transfer fee, which would also need to be negotiated and fit within Charlotte FC's budget.
// * **Player Preference:** It's essential to consider Abram's preference and whether he is interested in joining Charlotte FC.

// **Overall:**

// Based solely on the financial and roster implications, the proposed trade of Luis Abram to Charlotte FC is feasible. However, other factors, such as player availability, transfer fees, and player preference, would also need to be considered before completing the trade.`;
